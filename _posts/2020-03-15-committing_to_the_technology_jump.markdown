When it comes to TV, I am always attached to the "smart-person" in the group. Data (Star Trek: The Next Generation), Billy (Blue Ranger - Power Rangers), Felicity Smoak (Arrow). But perhaps the one that stands out the most was Izzy from Digimon. Izzy was a computer whiz-kid and I thank his character for sparking my interests in computer science and coding. I even remember asking for a laptop for Christmas just for the chance to dive into the hieroglyphic language on his laptop (the year was 1999 - all of this was new).

Fast-forward to adulthood and I unfortunately did not pursue computers heavily. Some of it was that my greatest influences (my parents) hardly knew what a computer was and wouldn't be supportive of a career in technology. Some of it was never having access to a computer until I was too busy to teach myself to code. Now I know better. I am fortunate enough to find myself at a career change, a new path in my travels. 

The opportunity to carve a new path with technology is right up my alley. I think it compliments my existing skillsets and personality traits - and it doesn't hurt that the field is bursting with ripe career opportunities. I am jumping ship to board the tech train because I know that the era of the computer is just getting started and I want to be part of whatever comes next!
