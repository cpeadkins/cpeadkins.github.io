*I completed my first project and it was frustrating and exhilarating all at once.*

#### Stepping out of the Comfort-Zone 
I learned that I enjoy the freedom of writing a program that is in-line with my interests and capabilities. But there is something unsettling about having no structure for completion (other than the Flatiron checklist). Posting code you personally created on Github invites outside eyes and potentially harsh critique from future employers and other developers. Being a perfectionist (like myself) means you struggle with commitment. "git commit -m 'Means I struggle with accepting my imperfect code and pushing this to forever be recorded and possibly judged!" (code pun intended). 

My advice to developers who also struggle with this phenomenon? Get over yourself. You are your harshest critic. Code, Debug/Fix, Repeat. *It is okay to struggle. It is okay to evolve.*

#### Technical Difficulties
It is okay not to know everything is a reality in code that we need to accept early. As my project evolved, so did my understanding of ways to break it. My project prompts the user for a date so it can access an API index that spits out information associated with that date. The simple task of forcing the user input to loop until the correct format is input is surprisingly frustrating. Do I use ```if``` ? ```when``` ? What are my conditional statements? How do I prevent illogical inputs?

And the struggle begins. (At least I had a little fun. I think coding easter-eggs into my programs would be a distraction from the hair-ripping frustrations.)

It took me too long to find the ```Date.today``` Ruby operator. Starting out means learning there are convient applicable shortcuts that will help you keep your sanity.

#### In short ...
In the end, I'm still learning and that can be frustrating in itself. Google can only help so much especially when you only know some Ruby and the solutions to your bugs are beyond your knowledge set. I keep reminding myself to stay focused and stay positive. In the end it will be worth it.
